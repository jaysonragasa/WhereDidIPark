A simple yet powerful smartwatch app built with .NET MAUI to help you find your parked car. Never get lost in a parking lot again!

This project serves as a practical example of a watch-first application using .NET MAUI, demonstrating how to effectively use device sensors and create a responsive, glanceable UI for wearables.

### Key Features
